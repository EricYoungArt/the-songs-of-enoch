<div class="intro-description">
  <p><em>The Songs of Enoch</em> is a mythic graphic narrative born from a deep inner calling to reimagine the origin of life, humanity, and the divine. Through hand drawn visuals and poetic storytelling, it retells the Genesis creation story through a shamanic lensâ€”unfolding through the eyes of Enoch, the firstborn son of Cain, witness to the fall of man and the mysteries that shaped the cosmos.</p>
